# Assignment 2 Instructions
For Assignment 2 of this class, you will compose an email to a friend.
## Audience
Your friend “Charlie.” (Charlie is a “[persona](https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/process/user-research/putting-personas-to-work-in-ux-design/#content),” an archetypical user whose goals and characteristics represent the needs of a larger group of users.)
## Purpose
To advise your friend Charlie how to write well in a professional setting.
## Occasion
### Tl;dr
Charlie, an engineer who is not a strong writer, needs some advice from you, their friend who they know can write well. 

After much hard work and several long years of undergraduate education, Charlie has graduated with an engineering degree. Charlie is nervous about being able to write well in a professional setting.  Charlie avoided taking any non-required writing classes such as WRIT-2313 - Professional Writing, because Charlie wanted to prioritize the classes that enabled them to finish their engineering coursework. Charlie starts their new job at a prestigious company next month, where they will be an entry-level associate engineer. Charlie is asking you, their friend who took many writing classes, for a summary of how to write well in a professional setting.

You can invent other details about Charlie as needed for composing your letter, like the type of engineering work they will be doing, gender/pronouns, college they attended, employer, etc.
## Other requirements
- Write 700 to 800 words
- Pick 3 to 5 core ideas based on topics covered in class so far to convey to Charlie, such as the ones listed below, and write around 100 words per idea explaining why it’s important, how to successfully implement it, and so on. You can include examples or images as permitted by markdown (see next section).
- You can look back at the agenda for topics we have covered so far this semester. Here are some suggestions:
    - Considering Audience, Purpose, and Occasion to make choices about writing
    - Document usability (such as headings, density, typeface choices, tl;dr and CRAP)
    - How to write useable documentation
    - Project management software
    - Acceptance criteria
    - User stories
    - Personas
    - QA testing
    - User acceptance testing
    - Presenting data and information within documents
    - A topic of your choosing that we have not covered in class but you can cite a good source for.
        - “Common grammar, punctuation, or sentence structure errors” and “writing for brevity” might be good candidates. These are important to professional writing but they are more appropriate topics to learn in Grammar or Revising & Editing classes than a Professional Writing class, so they have not made it onto our agenda.
- Cite a reading on this topic in the letter - you can use phrasing like “You can read more about this idea [here](google.com).”
## Submission Instructions
- Submit your assignment using Github by doing the following:
    - Create a branch of this repository. Put your name somewhere in your branch.
    - Create a file called <your_name>.md (for example, sam_campbell.md). Make sure the file is in the folder called “Assignment 2.”
        - A .md file is a markdown file, meaning that you will write markdown in order to add formatting like headings, paragraphs, links, and so on. Markdown is a very basic form of writing code.
        - You can either compose your file as a markdown file from the outset, or you can write it in Google Docs or Microsoft Word, and then transfer it to Markdown later.
        - [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/) is a tool that makes it trivially easy to write markdown. You can look at the markdown code on the left side and the rendered HTML output on the right side.
        - You can use any other tool or workflow you want to write your letter, as long as you are doing your own original work, and as long as you ultimately submit a .md file.
    - Put your assignment text and formatting into that .md file.
    - Only modify your own .md file.
    - Use Git to commit your changes to your branch and merge your branch into “main” using a pull request.
        - You learned how to do this in the [Github Hello World](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world) tutorial.
    - The .md file that has your name on it, is in the Assignment 2 folder, and is on the “main” branch is what will eventually be graded.
## What I care about/What you’ll be graded on
- Show that you have learned:
    - The topics you’re writing to Charlie about
    - How to make changes and upload those changes using Git/Github
- You will be graded on basic grammar and punctuation.
- Overall the tone and format should reasonably match the circumstances of writing to a friend who is seeking your advice.
