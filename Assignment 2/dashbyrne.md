# Dear Charlie,
I won't bother with introductions or conclusions. You know why I'm writing this, read on and learn.

## Context, Context, Context

- Who are you writing to? (Audience)
- What do you hope to accomplish? (Purpose)
- Why write this, to these people, with these goals, now? (Occasion)

Context exists at the intersection of these three ideas, when a writer synthesizes each to understand how they might accomplish their goals though writing. It is the most vital part of effective writing. To give you a better grasp, let's go in-depth on each aspect of context. 

### Audience

> Judge, Jury, and Executioner

The audience is anyone-- your boss, your father, your spouse-- whom you wish to persuade or otherwise affect with your writing. As you are not writing for creative purposes, you need not work with an "ambiguous audience" of consumers; instead, you should be able to directly identify who will be reading your writing. Once you determine who you are trying to reach with writing, you should isolate some of their qualities which you're familiar with. Are they emotionally sensitive? A hardass who can't read between the lines? Maybe they're a writer themselves, and you need to focus on form over content. The status and personality of your audience is essential to writing-- and when composing for an audience of multiple people, the "middle ground" must be identified. 

### Purpose

> Why the hell should you even bother?

So, you found your target. Congratulations! Now, what do you want from them? An endowment for a new crane? More hires? A raise? Why are you asking _them?_ Purpose goes beyond goals-- it's also about why you're making the appeal in writing, as opposed to verbally. Not just that; you should also consider why the goal must be achieved, as there's no purpose for something unecessary. Perhaps there's company red-tape requiring written requests, or perhaps you need to send it to an external office where you won't be around to "defend" the writing. Both of these would require seperate approaches-- the former might give you more leniency in your writing, as everyone in the company experiences the same process; meanwhile, the latter would require great care and caution to ensure that your writing is clear enough to stand independently. 

### Occasion

> So what?

Why do you care? Why should they care? Perhaps your purpose is more hires for your team-- how short-staffed are you? What would happen if you continued working with too few people? Are there potential roadblocks between you and the goal? Occasion is a trickier thing, as it often requires a comfortable grasp of the first two contextual ideas before it forms.

## Passive and Active Voice
These are terms you might have heard but aren't familiar with the meanings of. To put it simply, there are two halves to a "correct" sentence: subject and predicate. The subject-- the "topic" of the sentence or "do-er" of the action-- comes first in active voice:
> The man opened the door.

In passive voice, the placement is reversed:
>The door was opened by the man.

There's no prescriptive rule for these, but you generally want to use active voice _much, much_ more. Passive voice has "weak" phrasing and can lead to odd, irregular sentences that you wouldn't verbally speak. Examples of when to use passive voice include sentences with unclear subjects-- such as discussing "unskilled" labor.
>The grass was cut.
The dishes were washed.

This is one of those rules that's hard to grasp without experience. Just keep an eye on sentence structure and make sure it all "flows." Purdue's [Online Writing Lab](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/grammar/) is a great tool for grammer checks and citation help. 
## On Form and Document Usability
Finally, comes the matter of form and composition. Your context is established, your content is decided, and you have a strong grasp of syntax and grammar-- now it's time to make that memo look damn professional. When you're focusing on style, remember [CRAP](https://www.presentationzen.com/chapter6_spread.pdf):
### Contrast
Don't use yellow text on a white background, or bright-white on black. You want to find a middle-ground where the text is easily legible and readable, but not so contrasting as to cause eye strain. Contrast can also be considered between different elements to draw attention to one or the other.
### Repetition
"Consistency" is a more applicable term; basically, use the same fundamentals in your design philosophy throughout the text. 
### Alignment
Within a given section of the text, this is how elements work with one another-- think of it as repetition on a smaller scale. 
### Proxemity
This one should be self-explanatory: related items should be kept together, while distinct ones should be seperated. I'm sure an engineer such as yourself understands organizational principles like this-- just translate it to the page.
