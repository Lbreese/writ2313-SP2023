# Assignment 2: Letter to Charlie

### Hey, Charlie! Congrats on the job; I completely understand how excited and anxious you are and I’m more than happy to offer advice. 
Writing in a professional setting really isn’t as esoteric or complicated as it might seem. To make it as easy as possible, here are three key topics that should help you as much as they’ve helped me:

### 1: Audience/Purpose/Occasion
Making sure what you write is appropriate to the situation at hand is a great way to avoid confusion. Ensuring efficiency in how you incorporate information into your writing helps proactively avoid mistakes. You can do both by remembering your **Audience, Purpose, and Occasion.**

- When thinking about your **Audience**, ask yourself who this writing is for. You may want to adopt a more formal tone with “higher-ups” and supervisors than with the coworkers you talk with every day. Similarly, you may need to consider what vocabulary you use, as a supervisor may not have an intimate working knowledge of technical terms that you’re more familiar with.

- Your **Purpose** is the specific data you need to communicate. Striving to make sure your purpose is apparent and not lost in formality or extra details will always be to your benefit. For this reason, you’ll need to prioritize what information is the most important to be sure that it doesn’t get glossed over in favor of something unnecessary. When writing an email to a coworker, it’s likely more important to tell them that your project deadline has been moved up than letting them know a meeting has been rescheduled.

- **Occasion** is why this writing needs to happen, or what your writing is for. Emails are for brief, but important information or questions. Moreover, as an engineer, you’ll likely be required to document your process and make reports on your work. Documentation is for posterity and reference, while a report may be more formal and detail-oriented. Keeping an eye on your occasion builds efficiency; this [article](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/you-don-t-have-too-much-documentation---how-to-write-useable-documentation#close-modal) goes into further depth.

### 2: Quality & Customers
I understand that you’re going into civil engineering, and I can’t imagine a field in which quality and customer satisfaction would be more important. Terms that you should familiarize yourself with are **User Acceptance Criteria and User Acceptance Testing.**

- Essentially, the people who will eventually use any systems or buildings you create are your **Users**. When designing, it’s helpful to have clearly defined **User Acceptance Criteria**, or the desired outcome from the User’s perspective. This is more nuanced than just an end goal, as it centers the creative process around your Users. I’m sure you have experience in designing bridges, but if the bridge you design doesn’t accommodate for the kind of traffic it will receive it will likely cause a lot of problems.

- That brings us to **User Acceptance Testing**, or the process of testing what you’ve created to be sure it’s in line with the Acceptance Criteria. This is more a process of checking your work, and documenting the outcome. While that may sound like homework, it is a critical part of the process. You can discover unexpected blindspots and use documentation to prove what you’ve done. You can find further reading [here](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/engineering/user-acceptance-testing/).

### 3: Presenting Data
You mentioned being anxious about presenting your work to your supervisors. Firstly, it really won’t be all that different from handing an assignment in to your professors. Secondly, using **Visual Aids** will not only help you appear more professional, but will also help convey information effectively.
There are plenty of different styles of charts and graphs, but **clear and concise is always better than eye-catching and complex.** 

- At this point you may be questioning how to tell when and whether formal communication or good communication takes priority. Here’s a chart to illustrate the answer:

### This is by no means an exhaustive list of everything I learned from my professional writing class, but it should be enough to help you make a good first impression. 
If you still feel like a fish out of water after a year or so, you could consider a graduate degree from St. Edwards; you’ll have plenty of time to take a professional writing class then! 

Best of luck on your new career path, and don’t hesitate to ask for more advice.

**Sincerely,**

**Juniper**
