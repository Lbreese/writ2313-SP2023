## _Email to Charlie_

Dear Charlie, 

I know you’ve been searching for a job in your field since graduation; I’m overjoyed to hear the news of your new position as an engineer at Tesla. I understand that this position comes with its challenges, one of them being having to write professionally more often than you’re used to. In the email you sent me, you made it clear that writing professionally is not your strong suit because you had to focus on your engineering coursework and didn’t have the time to take any non-required writing courses at St. Ed’s. Luckily for you, my major requires me to take all the writing courses you weren’t able to–including Intro to Professional Writing–and I would be happy to teach you about three important topics to keep in mind while writing for a professional setting.



1. **Considering Audience, Purpose, and Occasion** 

    When writing professionally, it's important to think about audience, purpose, and occasion because they help you make informed decisions about your writing. Furthermore, you need to keep these three things in mind because you have to adjust the formality and complexity of your language depending on who you’re writing for–who your audience is. In the occasion of a professional email, you can assume that your boss knows technical language about the subject you’re emailing them about; and you can assume that you’re expected to use that language. But, when you’re texting me, you would not use any technical language because I know nothing about engineering. In a professional email, you would include complicated information, but you wouldn’t do that if you were telling me how you spent your day at work. Ultimately, The purpose of your writing affects how you write; you want to inform your boss about how the project he assigned to you is going, but you may need to dumb down your language if you are texting me more than you would need to with your boss/colleagues.

2. **Saving Yourself Time by Including an FAQ section**

    Charlie, the truth is, you’re going to be writing many emails with this new job. Sometimes they may be to your boss, but most of the time you'll be emailing your team. You'll be sending them progress reports on an ongoing project or notifying them about the start of a new project. Emails to your coworkers will often end up in follow-up emails with questions about the information you sent. While communication is good, it's a waste of time to respond to emails asking the same questions. That's why including an FAQ–Frequently Asked Questions–section at the end of your email is so important. An FAQ section can be as simple as restating some of the points made during the email as a question. For example, let’s say the email you sent talks about the start of a new project, your FAQ section can answer questions such as, “When will we meet to talk more in detail about the project?” “By when does the project have to be completed?” etc. The point of an FAQ section is to clear up any confusion your email may have caused, that's why you'll locate it at the end.

3. **Presenting Data and Information Within Documents**

    I can imagine that writing about information supported by quantitive/visual data will be a large sum of what you’ll do in your new job. Presenting this data/information correctly will be vital. Even though I’ve been emphasizing the importance of writing professionally, this is the one-time writing less will get you a better response. You could go on paragraphs describing the data/information, but nothing you write will be as descriptive as a visual. Including a visual in a document about data will make it easier for your readers to understand since long paragraphs may confuse readers–and you don’t want to be stuck responding to questions. 
    
    The best way to insert the data is by placing the visual in-between paragraphs. Whatever visual you use must make sense with the data you’re presenting. For example, a pie chart wouldn’t be the best choice if you’re comparing two values–in that case, show the values and don’t get fancy. Furthermore, be aware of the design elements. Let’s say you’re using a compare-and-contrast bar graph as your visual, and the bars are varying shades of green; that would be ineffective and confuse your readers. You can learn more about data and information visualization [here](https://writingcommons.org/article/data-visualizations/).


I hope these three topics help you as you start writing professionally more often. If you are still worried about anything or if I left you with any questions, please feel free to reach out. Can’t wait to hear about your first day at Tesla!

Best wishes,

Pao Sanchez
